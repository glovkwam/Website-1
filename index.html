          <h2>Digital Media Artist + Front-end Developer</h2>

          <p>Hello my name is Kwame and I am a 21 year old web developer living in
            San Leandro, California. I am currently attending San Jose State
            Univeristy. I started at SJSU as a Business major with a concentration in Entreprenuership, but I have recently
            decided to change my major to Digital Media Art. So far, I have earned
            my minor in general business  and am working towards getting my
            BFA in Digital Media Art. In my spare time, I enjoy making youtube
            videos about cryptocurrency and am interested in the idea of
            decentralized finance. I am also learning the basics of web
            development including programs such as Python and JavaScript.</p>
          <p>Please Subsribe to my Youtube Channel :) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChzGLyBYsvcZU0Y95hxfRPg?themeRefresh=1" target="_blank">CryptoKwam</a>, I make cryptocurrency Technical Anaysis videos and discuss decentralized finance.</p>

            <h3>Spinning Triangle  / With P5js</h3>
            <p>For this art piece, I used JavaScript to code a spinning trinagle. One thing I like about this piece is that I was able to use angleMode(degrees) to create an afterimage affect for the triangle. </p>
